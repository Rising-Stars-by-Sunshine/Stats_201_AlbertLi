# Literature Review: A Survey of Forex and Stock Price Prediction Using Deep Learning

### Machine Learning Methodology: Prediction/Optimization

Hu et al. performed a comprehensive survey of recent credible foreign exchange (Forex) and stock prediction algorithms. The survey focused on prediction and optimization, as these algorithms optimally predict future price trends. 

### Background and Motivation

The stock market is influenced by many factors, including but “not limited to macroeconomic factors, the market anticipation, and confidence in the company’s management and operation” (Hu et al., 2021, p. 1). Like stocks, Forex uses a decentralized market for currency exchanges and is influenced by domestic conditions. Additionally, universal access to the Internet enabled the widespread transmission of information, amplifying the frequency and magnitude of market adjustments (Hu et al., 2021, p. 1).

The authors continue to discuss the development of AI technologies in many fields. Specifically, Hu et al. (2021) note AI applications in natural language processing (NLP), image recognition and classification, and trend predictions. These techniques are known to be able to predict stock and Forex prices by “describ[ing] complex influencing factors” (Hu et al., 2021, p. 1). 

 As stated by the authors, the article aims to “investigate the different effects of different deep learning methods on stock and Forex forecasting” by analyzing the performance of various algorithms (Hu et al., 2021, p. 2). Through this article, the authors intended to highlight deep learning categories and performance evaluation metrics, determining the best-performing algorithms for each performance measurement.

### Research Question

 The article serves as a summary of recent developments in deep learning for predicting Forex and stock trends. Therefore, the article seeks to answer the following:
 
- What are the price prediction effectiveness of various deep-learning methods?
- What are the most common evaluatory metrics for Forex and stock prediction algorithms?
- Which models and algorithms performed the best for each evaluatory metric?

### Application Scenarios

 This paper’s findings help to direct future research into stock and Forex prediction algorithms. By assessing the performance of numerous deep learning models, the study provides insight into which methods are the most promising for accurate price prediction. Additionally, the paper identifies characteristics highly correlated to market trends and performance metrics. These insights can inform investment strategies, risk management practices, and financial decision-making processes.

### Methodology

The article grouped relevant deep-learning methods into six categories: convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), deep neural network (DNN), reinforcement learning, and other deep learning methods (Hu et al., 2021, p. 3). 

According to Hu et al. (2021), CNNs are “composed of multiple neurons connected by a hierarchical structure,” and their ability to alter “weights and bias[es] between layers” contributes to its “powerful pattern recognition ability”. RNNs excel “at modeling and processing sequential data”, as they are “able to memorize the previous state” to factor it into “the current state calculation” (Hu et al., 2021, p. 2). LTSM extends RNN’s features, capable of “self-looping” to guide the optimization process that is commonly lost “when the RNN model updates the weights” (Hu et al., 2021, p. 3). DNNs have hidden layers that allow “for complicated nonlinear functions” and “high-level abstraction ability” (Hu et al., 2021, p. 3). In other words, DNNs draw unclear relationships between variables with high accuracy. Reinforcement learning is a new deep learning technique that reacts to “the current situation to profit maximiz[e]” by “continuously adjusting the previous strategy through feedback from the results” (Hu et al., 2021, p. 3). Finally, Hu et al. (2021) combined other deep learning methods such as “Hybrid Attention Networks (HAN), self-paced learning mechanism (NLP), multi-filter neural networks (MFNN), and Wavenet” into a final category.

To perform their analysis, the authors systematically reviewed selected papers, filtering based on keywords and quality. Articles including one of six deep-learning techniques along with “stock/Forex” were chosen to “ensure the papers reviewed are relevant” (Hu et al., 2021, p. 4). Additionally, the authors excluded articles “that were informally published as well as those without a minimum of 5 citations” (Hu et al., 2021, p. 4). From these papers, the authors recorded the dataset, variables, model, evaluatory metrics, and results. 

### Results

The survey performed analysis based on methods and performance metrics. For each, the authors indicated the papers with the highest and lowest performance. Notably, LSTM models that implement secondary techniques have garnered significant research attention and have demonstrated promising results. Additionally, the authors pointed out the “lack of studies on the combination of multiple deep learning methods,” stating that “hybrid networks are showing promising signs for future research” (Hu et al., 2021, p. 26). 

### Intellectual Merits/Practical Impacts

This survey highlights the rising trend with financial model prediction algorithms implementing deep learning techniques, underscoring their increasing popularity and effectiveness in predicting stock and Forex market movements. The identified trends and successful approaches provide valuable guidance for both researchers and practitioners seeking to improve their predictive capabilities in the realm of financial markets. Moreover, the study's rigorous evaluation framework and performance metrics contribute to the methodological advancement of research in this critical domain. Ultimately, the insights gleaned from this survey have the potential to significantly impact investment strategies, risk management practices, and financial decision-making processes in both individual and institutional contexts.
