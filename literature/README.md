# Literature Review

This study builds upon research on r/WallStreetBets's (WSB) effect on financial trends, the RoBERTa model, and social media sentiment analysis.

### ![Lyócsa et al., 2021]()
Lyócsa et al.'s research dived into r/WallStreetBet's impact on prices, an event they termed the "YOLO effect". When compared with previous short squeezes, the researchers observed a positive correlation between the WSB subreddit and increased price variation (Lyócsa et al., 2021). Lyócsa et al.'s findings validate the significance of the WSB community, making it a prime and valid target for social media sentiment analysis. Additionally, their findings lead to potential future research; their findings hint at the possibility of using WSB for targeted stock price prediction.
### ![Malik et al., 2023]()
Malik et al. dived into the optimization of the RoBERTa model, a modified version of BERT used to capture "hope" in multilingual text. RoBERTa's ability to provide multilingual "hope" text support makes it ideal for social media sentiment analysis, as many user posts exhibit opinions and perspectives. Despite this possibility, there hasn't been research into the prediction of new-age social media communication, a style full of sarcasm, jokes, and inconsistencies. Therefore, this research tests its applicability to Gen Z social media.
### ![Suhaimin et al., 2023]()
Suhaimin et al. did a deep dive into social media sentiment analysis, using past research and techniques to develop an optimized model for multiple social media platforms. While they did observe high performance, it's important to note their generalization of social media as a one-size-fits-all. While many users use conventional language, there is a rising generation that utilizes constantly changing terminology. This research highlights modern social media sentiment analysis models' performance on such users.
