The code will be comprised of two parts: web scraping and testing. The web scraping portion will be created using PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) to access the Reddit API and to scrape the contents of r/WallStreetBets. From each post, the post's textual content, upvotes, and comments will be extracted. To filter the resultant data, a threshold of 250 comments and upvotes will be applied to ensure the quality of each post. After filtering, I will perform manually labelling to assign each post to positive, neutral, or negative. For the testing, methodologies from multiple high-performing sentiment analysis models will run the r/WallStreetBets dataset on a 85-15 train-test split. Finally, the results will be compared with the true labels (created manually) to analyze for accuracy, f-measure, precision, and recall.
