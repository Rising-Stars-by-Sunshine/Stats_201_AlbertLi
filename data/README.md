This project involved extracting post information from r/WallStreetBets using the PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) library. The main focus was on three key elements: post content, upvotes, and comments. Utilizing Reddit API credentials, PRAW was employed to extract every post from r/WallStreetBets within the past year. The aim was to sort for quality by selecting posts with a minimum of 10000 upvotes and comments. This criterion was chosen to ensure that only posts with sufficient community interaction were included, indicating a potential shift in opinion or sentiment about a specific asset or the market as a whole.
