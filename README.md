Albert Li, '27, undecided major.
I'm a freshman at Duke Kunshan University (DKU) with a passion for both STEM and finance, although I haven't settled on a specific major just yet. I'm excited to explore the intersection of these fields and discover where my interests lie. In addition to my academic pursuits, I'm an active member of the DKU Finance Club and the DKU Pre-Law Society, allowing me to engage in discussions related to finance, investment, and economic trends, as well as explore the legal aspects of business and finance. Beyond my club involvement, I'm always seeking new opportunities to broaden my horizons and make meaningful connections on campus, believing that diverse experiences will guide me toward a fulfilling academic and professional journey at DKU.
